## **Life of Pi 🐯 👨‍🦱**
> Adventure/Drama
 + It is a story of a young man who survives a harrowing shipwreck and months in a lifeboat with a large Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. I like this movie because of the symoblisms that are present in the story which teaches its viewers important lesson about life.

## **3 Idiots 👨‍🔬 👷‍♂️ 🧔‍📷**
> Comedy/Romance
+ The movie talks about the friendship of three students at an Indian engineering college and is a satire about the social pressures under an Indian education system. The movie is told through equal dramas, one in the present and the other ten years earlier. I like this movie because portrays our lives in college. It may be hard to survive every obstacle that may come our way but what's important is that we remained strong in order to achieve our goals in life.
